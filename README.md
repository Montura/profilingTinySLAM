# CSC 2016 profiling tinySLAM

Directory "profilers" - three programms that I used to profile tinySLAM. Each one has wiki-file and executable version of tiny_slam that was compiled with appropriate flags.

Other directories - three versions of tinySLAM source code:
- default
- without observers
- reserve memory

profiling_manual.pdf - read it before doing something

MikhalevTinySlam.pdf - results of profiling

tiny_slam - video showing how tinySLAM works.
